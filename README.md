## dataset

This paper sets glass bottles as experiment objects. The data set is collected from a prototyping platform. Firstly, we set 2000 percussion signals generated from 1000 defective and 1000 defect-free bottles as experiment data. Then, we divide all data into the training set with 1200 signals and the test set with 800 signals. Among training set and testing set, the defective and defect-free bottles have equal sample number.

It is noted that there are two splitting method for dataset, which is respectively split randomly and by time.
